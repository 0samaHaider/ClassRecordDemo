# Understanding Classes and Records in C#

## Introduction

In C#, classes serve as fundamental building blocks for object-oriented programming (OOP). They enable the creation of blueprints for objects, encapsulating both data and behavior. The language introduced a noteworthy feature in C# 9.0 known as "records," offering a concise method to define immutable classes with value semantics.

## Classes in C#

**Definition:**
A class is a user-defined type representing a blueprint for creating objects. Instances of a class encapsulate both data (fields or properties) and behavior (methods).

## Records in C# (C# 9.0 and later)

**Definition:**
A record is a new reference type introduced in C# 9.0, providing a succinct syntax for declaring immutable classes. Records are particularly beneficial for modeling data where both equality and immutability are paramount.
